# Vocabulary

## Statically Typed
- This means that the type of a variable (like `int`, `string`, etc) is known and fixed at compile time (before the program runs).
- You can't change the type later in the program, which helps avoid errors.

## Compiled Lanuage
- Go code is translated (compiled) into machine code (the language that computers understand) by a tool called a compiler.
- This process happens before you run your program, making it faster and more efficient when it's executed.

## Simplicity
- Go was designed to be easy to read and write. There aren't tons of complicated features - just the essentials, which hekps programmers focus on solving problems.

## Efficiency 
- Go uses memorey and processing power wisely, allowing programs to do a lot with fewer resources. This makes it suitable for handling large systems.
